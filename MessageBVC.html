Naw, just kidding.
Boss, it's so sad to see you go ðŸ˜­ (to the other end), but thanks for being my boss the past 4.5 years. It's been a wild ride since the COVID days, and I truly appreciate how supportive you've been since day oneðŸ’ª, especially during the almost NPL situationâ€”guess I'm still here! Thanks for being such a cool boss who jokes around with us and gives us exemplary advice ðŸ’¯. Visit us sometime, okay? Your next move will be tough, but I know you'll adapt and do great.
</br>
<br>
Best regards, boss (for the last time),
<br>

P.S. You owe me a better card."</p></p>
