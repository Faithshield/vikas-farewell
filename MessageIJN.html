Thank you for being our boss for the past 4 years! Thank you for inspiring us with your random nuggets of wisdom / story time and for inspiring us with your never-ending quest for knowledge. We know who to look out for if we need any advice on CPF as well as renovation advice! Will miss the sounds and smell of the coffee machine and your love for caifan :( Thank you for always looking out for us and for always being the team's biggest cheerleader! We wouldn't be where we are today if not for you and your leadership! Wishing you all the best in your new role and the journey ahead and we will always be a few blocks away ðŸ¤£
