      <p>"Hi boss! </br><br>
can’t believe you’re really leaving us 😭 it was an amazing four and a half years working with you! you’ve been really fun and relatable, and i’ve always enjoyed your stories whether it was during lunchtime or during our mini office gatherings during tea break 🙊 i’ll definitely miss the sessions where we worked from your place (and most definitely whiskey 😭🐶) thank you so much for your guidance and patience throughout the years, and hope you all the best for your new role in plans! 💪🏼 if you miss us, we’ll just be a few rows down the office 😆🌟✨"</p>
