</br>
<br>
Dear Jim,
</br>
<br>
It is with a heavy heart that I acknowledge the end of our work marriage. From navigating tight deadlines to the countless meetings-that-could’ve-been-emails (and yes, some emails can be quite ridiculous too), we’ve always had each other’s backs. But now, you’re off to a new role, and we’ll be holding down the fort here.
</br>
<br>
Stay strong in your new adventure! Just because we’re “divorced” doesn’t mean we can’t still support each other. I’ll be here if you ever need a pep talk, a vent session, or just someone to complain about meetings with.
</br>
<br>
Thank you for being the exemplary boss who could juggle data and still crack a joke.
</br>
<br>
Always your (ex)work spouse,
</br>
<br>
Cindy"</br></p>
