I dun think I will ever find a better boss than you.</br><br>
3 things that really touched me are:</br><br>
1. Broadcasting small victories to management</br><br>
2. Sharing with me how you were like when you are young</br><br>
3. Calling HR (Literally)"</br><br></p>
Thanks for not only being a boss but also taking up the role of a missing someone in my life!</br><br>
Now upgrading you from boss to friend...
